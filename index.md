### Summary
With a solid foundation as a Programmer & Systems Architect, I have successfully transitioned into the role of a Solutions Architect, where I combine deep technical expertise with strategic oversight to deliver innovative and scalable solutions. My journey in the tech industry began with hands-on programming and systems design, which has given me a unique perspective on the intricacies of software development and system integration.

Over the years, I have expanded my skill set to encompass cloud architecture, enterprise systems, and digital transformation, allowing me to take a more holistic approach to solution design. This transition has enabled me to lead projects from concept to completion, ensuring that technical solutions align with business objectives and drive measurable results.
